# PasswordStrengthChecker

This application takes in a user-inputted password and checks its strength. More specifically, several different factors are checked to identify a strong password:
- the password's length should be 8 characters or longer
- the password should contain a uppercase character
- the password should contain a lowercase character
- the password should contain a digit
- the password should contain a special character
On the other hand, this application also takes into account two kinds of "checks" that can potentially crack the inputted password, those being:
- Dictionary check
- Brute Force Check
